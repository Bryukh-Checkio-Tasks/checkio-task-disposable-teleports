    The island has eight stations which are connected by a network of teleporters; however, the teleporters take a very long time to
    recharge. This means you can only use each one once. After you use a teleporter, it will shut down and no longer function. 
    For this task, you should begin at number 1 and try to travel around to all the stations before returning to the starting point. 
    The map of the teleporters is presented as a string in which the comma-separated list represents teleporters. 
    Each teleporter is given the name of the station it connects to. This name consists of two digits, such as '12' or '02.'
    Each test requires you to provide a route which passes through every station.
    A route is presented as a string of the station numbers in the sequence in which they must be visited
    (ex. 123456781).
