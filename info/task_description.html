    The island has eight stations, which are connected by teleports. However, the teleports take a very long time to
    recharge so you can only use each one once. After you use a teleport, it will not work again. Begin at number 1 and
    try to get around to all the stations before returning to the starting point. The map of the teleports is presented
    as a string, in which the comma-separated list represents teleports. Each teleport is named by the two digits (ex.
    12 or 21) of the stations that it connects. All tests require you to provide a route which passes through all
    stations. A route is presented as a string of the station numbers in the sequence in which they must be attended
    (ex. 123456781).
